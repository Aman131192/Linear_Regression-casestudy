## Introduction
A bike-sharing system is a service in which bikes are made available for shared use to individuals on a short term basis for a price or free. Many bike share systems allow people to borrow a bike from a "dock" which is usually computer-controlled wherein the user enters the payment information, and the system unlocks it. This bike can then be returned to another dock belonging to the same system.


## Problem Statement
A US bike-sharing provider BoomBikes has recently suffered considerable dips in their revenues due to the ongoing Corona pandemic. The company is finding it very difficult to sustain in the current market scenario. So, it has decided to come up with a mindful business plan to be able to accelerate its revenue as soon as the ongoing lockdown comes to an end, and the economy restores to a healthy state.


## Objective

They want to analyze the factors influencing the demand for shared bikes. More specifically, they seek insights into the factors impacting the demand for these shared bikes in the American market. The company aims to ascertain:

- The significance of variables in predicting the demand for shared bikes.
- The effectiveness of those variables in describing the dynamics of bike demand.

We need to create a model that predicts the demand for shared bikes based on the given independent variables. The management intends to use this model to discern how demand fluctuates with various features. By doing so, they can adjust the business strategy to align with demand levels and meet customer expectations. Additionally, the model serves as a valuable tool for the management to grasp the demand dynamics in a new market.
